# ft_printf

I Wrote a library that contains ft_printf(), a function that mimic the original printf()

## Usage
```
$> git clone https://github.com/Mushigarou/ft_printf.git
$> cd ft_printf
$> make
```
Now you have a static library `libftprintf.a` that you can link with other programs

## Handles :

- %c Prints a single character.
- %s Prints a string (as defined by the common C convention).
- %p The void * pointer argument has to be printed in hexadecimal format.
- %d Prints a decimal (base 10) number.
- %i Prints an integer in base 10.
- %u Prints an unsigned decimal (base 10) number.
- %x Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) lowercase format.
- %X Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) uppercase format.
- %% Prints a percent sign

## Exception : 
- Doesn't have the same buffer management as the original printf()
